## Traditional Way of Estimating Parties' Chances of Winning

::: {.nonincremental}
-   In a riding or at the national level
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/1_theoretical_example1.png){width=70%}
:::

::: {.notes}
It comes from the intuition <br>
Tradtional measures of vote intention fail to capture essential information about an electoral race 
:::


#
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/1_theoretical_example1.png){width=90%}

::: {.notes}
Let's take this fictional example. <br>
In this graph, the X-axis is the Projected Vote share of parties. <br>
We can come to the following conclusions in interpreting this graph: <br>
A has an excellent lead <br>
But B is a potential challenger <br>
C has no chance of winning.
:::


#
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/1_theoretical_example2.png){width=100%}

::: {.notes}
However, these conclusions completely go out the window when we interpret vote intention as a continuous spectrum <br>
EXPLAIN GRAPH <br>
Same fictional voters <br>
one side actual voters of the party, other side voters of other parties <br>
Ordered from Solid to fragile voters <br>
Ordered from reachable voters to unreachable <br>
Whole new set of conclusions <br>
A fragile shape <br>
B solid electoral base, but no potential to grow<br>
C small electoral base, but a lot of potential to grow<br>
so we can conclude that<br>
A and C are a communicating vase <br>
A has a good lead, but could relatively easily lose electors to party C<br>
B is easily in second place but cant go further. Hopes for A and C to separate votes between themselves. Will try to keep fragile electors<br>
C is far behind, but could make a play for fragile segments of the electorate of A.<br>
What if it does?
:::

#
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/1_theoretical_example3.png){width=100%}

::: {.notes}
We get a whole new picture.<br>
DRINK WATER
C and A switched<br>
Like I said, C could also gain less votes and give victory to B, but it is clear that the parties's strategies are far more different when we look deeper in the data.<br>
Operationalisation enables forecast and anticipate potential electoral swings like in this fictional example that traditional methods do not allow.<br>
Logic, intuition behind this.<br>
Two distincts concepts: potential for growth and vote solidity
:::

## Why Study It?

-   More nuanced interpretation of agregated vote intentions
-   Better allocation of parties' resources
-   Identifying parties' room to maneuver
-   Identifying parties' fragile segments of electorate
-   Improving electoral forecasting
-   Better anticipation of electoral swings

::: {.notes}
better alloc, example of party B: instead of trying to gain new voters, defend its fragile electors

## Election Forecasting {.smaller}

<!-- Ajouter une source par model --> 

-   Small history
-   Four classes of forecasting methods
    1.  Structural models
    2.  Models based on the traditional vote intention question
    3.  Vote expectations, wisdom of the crowd
    4.  Combination of the three
-   These four models do not capture essential information
    -   Potential swings
    -   Fragile segments

## Bridging this gap: the Relative Confidence Index (RCI)

<!-- Insister ici que c'est "théorique" -->

An innovative range approach to measure vote intention

::: {.notes}
to bridge this gap <br>
we bring forward a new range measure of vote intention<br>
relative confidence index
:::

## How is it Calculated?

![](graphs/pres_spsa24/2_rci_1.png)

::: {.notes}
to measure rci, we ask respondents on scale 0-10<br>
thats the continuous part<br>
WATER
:::


## How is it Calculated?
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/2_rci_2.png)

::: {.notes}
the relative part is that we<br>
substract the vote likelihood of the second party to vote likelhiood of the first: positive value<br>
Julie party a Tomas party c<br>
substract the vote likelihood of the first party to all other parties: negative value<br>
julie B and c<br>
positive: as you approach 10, the more solid is your vote<br>
negative: as you aproach 0, you gradually become a elector with more potential<br>

The measure has been introduced and presented descriptively in these 3 articles<br>
More descriptive rather than validating its value

## Theoretical Benefits of Such Measure

-   More suitable to multiparty systems
-   Adding layer of choices → reduction of prediction error
-   More nuance to deal with undecided voters
-   Alleviate uncertainty associated with attitude/behaviour discrepancies
-   Makes a difference between unreachable and reachable electors → [***potential for growth***]{style="font-size: 40pt; color: #00BFFF;"}
-   Makes a difference between a solid and a fragile voter → [***vote solidity***]{style="font-size: 40pt; color: #00BFFF;"}

# Data and Context

## Case Study

-   Quebec Provincial Election, 2022
- Election date: October 3rd, 2022
- First-past-the-post
- 125 electoral ridings
- Drastic decline of the majority government since then

::: {.notes}
alright if we go back to the research question, which is<br>
we used the months before and after Quebec Provincial Election of 2022 as case study<br>
for context, Quebec is a multiparty parliamentary system with first past the post elections where each party aims to elect a representative in 125 electoral ridings<br>
:::


## 2022 Election Results
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/6_casestudy_elxnresults.png)

::: {.notes}
CAQ (majority incumbent) won 90 ridings, majority of seats
If we look at the electoral results, we can clearly see that CAQ won by a landslide, even in popular vote.<br>
We can also observe the PQ, which had 15% of the popular vote and 2% of the seats
:::


## Projections from December 2023
![](graphs/pres_spsa24/6_casestudy_projections.png)

::: {.notes}
Projections from today show a complete different picture<br>
CAQ now sits 2nd in popular vote and 3rd in projected seats.<br>
CAQ **19 seats**
PQ is close to a majority with 57 projected seats and leads popular vote<br>

[Could we have forecasted the rise of the PQ?]{style="font-size: 47pt;"}

![](graphs/pres_spsa24/6_casestudy_projections.png){width=530px}

:::{.notes}
This case study is perfect to test the rci as a measure of potential for growth: in a matter of 14 months, the PQ went from 2% of the seats to 46%. This enormous rise can definitely be studied through the lenses of potential for growth and vote solidity. Impossible to predict using traditional measures

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
To obtain estimates of potential for growth and vote solidity in each electoral riding, we used a combination of monthly surveys taken before the 2022 election.<br>
We are currently in discussion to obtain data from the Vote Compasses, which would gather hundreds of thousands data points.<br>
We projected the survey data on populational data from 2021 Canadian Census<br>

To compare with actual projections, we collected data from the survey aggregator Qc125.com, which is equivalent to 538 in the USA.

# Methodology

::: {.notes}
The methodological part of this artile is related to the challenge of estimating the RCI at the riding level considering our 9000 data points
:::

## Estimating the RCI at the Riding-Level

::: {.nonincremental}
-   Step 1: compute regression models to predict the RCI using survey data
-   Step 2: predict those models on riding-level census data
-   Step 3: aggregate the RCI and its uncertainty using segments' weights in the riding
:::

:::{.notes}
So the 3 main steps are the following. We needed to estimate the negative and positive rci for each party in each riding.<br>
:::

## Step 1: Compute Regression Models to Predict the RCI Using Survey Data

-   Vote solidity: `lm(rci ~ age * langue * region * male)` but only for a party's current electoral base
-   Potential for growth: `lm(rci ~ age * langue * region * male)` but only for respondents who do not currently vote for the party
<!-- -   Vote intention: `multinom(party ~ age * langue * granular + male)` -->

:::{.notes}
Interaction term between age language gender and region<br>
The models were the same for vote sol and pot growth and were the same for each party<br>
Total of 10 models (5 parties TIMES 2 DV)<br>
<!-- Each riding was associated with one of the 17ish administrative regions of Quebec (some tweaks). Done because low number of respondents by some ridings.--->

When we look vote solidity, results are less what we expected<br>
CAQ is still leading. We expected CAQ to have more fragile ridings.<br>
Even though CAQ had solid vote, we still expect the following: PQ had high pot growth in ridings CAQ won.<br>
That means that if CAQ were to fail (which should not have been likely from this analysis), we should expect PQ to rise and not another challenger.<br>
This leads us to the following analysis using TRADITIONAL MEASURE, vote shares:

If we do the same graph but by changing the traditional measure with the potential for growth estimates...<br>
PQ is now clearly in the best position among challengers to take over if CAQ fails.<br>
Leads in 85% of the ridings<br>

:::

<!-- From this graph, PQ in good position in ridings CAQ won.-->
<!-- Needs a catalyst!!! -->

## Conclusions

1. PQ had high potential for growth in ridings won by the CAQ → confirmed
2. CAQ had low vote solidity overall → rejected

# Article Contributions

::: {.nonincremental}
-   Empirical results to validate the concept of potential for growth
-   Broadening the recognition of the concept in the field
-   Explore basic and simplified operationalisations

So this article brings some validation to the RCI and this method of aggregating it for Potential for Growth<br>
However, results are more intriguing in the case of vote solidity.<br>
The decline of the CAQ was not likely by the results presented in this article.<br>
Next steps for this article include more comlex and nuanced operationalisations as well as adding more case studies<br>

# Discussion & Next Steps

## The End of the Line?

-   Preliminary weak findings: caution against premature dismissal of the concept
-   Solid theoretical foundation, derived from logical intuitions
-   Only a handful of operationalisations have been explored as of yet
    -   Broad range of research possibilities

## Improving its Conceptualization

-   Catalysts
    -   Electoral campaign
    -   Salient events
    -   Parties' efforts to reach segments
-   Position of parties and public opinion on salient issues
    -   Parties' room to maneuver
-   Political sophistication
- Does potential for growth vary through time?

## Operationalisation of the Concepts

-   Challenge: need to start with simplistic measures before going into more complicated operationalisations
- Current limit: party models are independent one another
-   Catalysts

## More Case Studies

- 2021 Canadian Federal Election
- 2024 (?) Canadian Federal Election

## Improving the Models

-   Adding independent variables (income, education, etc.)
    -   Need more data points to add independent variables → VPL (Vote Compass)
    -   (For the synthetic post-stratification table)
-   Testing other types of models
    -   Random forest
    -   Gradient boosting

## Survey Experiments: Better Validation at the Individual Level

-   Panel before and after election to follow the variation across the same individuals
- Survey experiments to test potential framing effects

## The ***Real*** End of the Line {.smaller}

<!-- faire un lien avec mon mémoire -->

**Theoretically valid quantitative indicators of:**

-   The propensity of an individual or group to support a political party, given targeted efforts towards them.
-   The fragility of segments within a party's current electoral base
-   The room to maneuver of parties
    -   Optimal positions on salient issues
    -   Segments to target
    - Valuable information for political communication
-   The estimable number of seats that is possibly reachable by a party if an election campaign would be launched today
  - Given its current positions on salient issues
  - Given its optimal positions on salient issues

we can see this kind of vizualisation<br>
where we see the mean rci of a party's voters for other parties.<br>
by looking through the 2018 panel, we could interpret that the PQ had high potential for growth for electors of CAQ and QS

in this paper that I wrote, trying to get published with my colleague gurth rémy<br>
some weak validation of the rci as a condition for local electoral volatility 
:::

## Theoretical Benefits of Such Measure

-   More suitable to multiparty systems
-   Adding layer of choices → reduction of prediction error
-   More nuance to deal with undecided voters
-   Alleviate uncertainty associated with attitude/behaviour discrepancies
-   Makes a difference between unreachable and reachable electors → [***potential for growth***]{style="font-size: 40pt; color: #00BFFF;"}
-   Makes a difference between a solid and a fragile voter → [***vote solidity***]{style="font-size: 40pt; color: #00BFFF;"}


## Validity at the Individual Level

::: {.notes}
What does it mean to be a 3, a -2 or a 6?
Here we have the aggregated predictive outcomes of a logit regression with the traditional, binary vote intention question as the DV<br>
it allows us to pinpoint some threshold where the RCI is more surely turned into a vote intention<br>
Limit: vote intent at the same point in time than the rci, so really just matter of coherence of respondents
